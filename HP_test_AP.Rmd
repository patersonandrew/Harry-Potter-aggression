Hi Andrew
Let's Make a graph of Harry Potter vs malfoy acts of aggression

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge")+ #dodge splits from stacked column to dodged. fill = Name colors bars by designated variable
  coord_flip()
  

hp_graph

```
